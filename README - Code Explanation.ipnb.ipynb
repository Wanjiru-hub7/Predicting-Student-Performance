    "# Student Performance Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the Project\n",
    "This project is about predicting the perfomance of the students based on various factors like study time, past grades, and other school-related factors. The  idea is to see which students may need extra help early.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Info\n",
    "- The dataset has the following features: attendance, study hours, Previous grade, Extracurricular activities, Parental support, Final grade, and online class(ture/false)\n",
    "- The target is the final grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I Did\n",
    "- Explored the dataset by checking for any missing value, outliers and incorrect datatypes\n",
    "- I cleaned it by dropping the missing values and created visualizations for the outliers\n",
    "- Created new features that would be meaningful to the dataset and encoded categorical data.\n",
    "- Removed highly correlated features using VIF.\n",
    "- Split the data (80% training, 20% testing).\n",
    "- Trained a machine learning model using the 80%\n",
    "- Evaluated it using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "The model didn’t perform very well as the accuracy was 0.38 meaning it was 38% accurate, which means it wasn’t able to pick up strong patterns from the data. This shows that the dataset might need better features or a different model.\n",
