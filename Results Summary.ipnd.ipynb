    "# Student Performance Prediction Report\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Goal\n",
    "The goal was to understand which features influence performance and to build a machine learning model that can help identify the final grade of the students and ackowledge who may need extra support.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Variable:** \n",
    "Final grade\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Model Used in this prediction\n",
    "The machine learning classification model that was trained to predict the final grade was Random Forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Model Evaluation Results\n",
    "The model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n",
    "The final results ganered were:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accuracy:** 0.38  \n",
    "- **Precision:** 0.41  \n",
    "- **Recall:** 0.38  \n",
    "- **F1 Score:** 0.37  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Interpretation of Results\n",
    "The results show that the model struggled to identify strong patterns in the dataset.  \n",
    "The low accuracy and F1 score suggest that:\n",
    "- Many predictions were incorrect  \n",
    "- More feature engineering or a different model may be needed  \n",
    "Although the model performance was low, the project demonstrates how data preparation, feature engineering, and evaluation work in practice.\n",
